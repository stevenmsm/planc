A-->Distributed NMF Library
=======================

In this repository, we offer both MPI and OPENMP implementation for MU, HALS and ANLS/BPP based NMF algorithms. This can run off the shelf as well easy to integrate in other source code. 
These are very highly tuned NMF algorithms to work on super computers. We have tested
this software in [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/edison/) as well [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) cluster. The openmp implementation is tested on
many different linux variants with intel processors. The library works well for both sparse and dense matrix.

In this library we support the following

* Shared Memory [OPENMP](openmp/README.md)  based implementation
* Distributed Memory [MPI](mpi/README.md) based implementation
